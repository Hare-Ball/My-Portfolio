            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <img src="./Assets/images/Palo-Duro-Profile-Pic.jpg" alt="Robert Hare Picture">
            <p>My name is Robert Hare. I am an aspiring web developer in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.
                I hold a Bachelor of Arts from Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas.
                I have also been an educator and public speaker, and have come to believe that everyone can learn and grow.
                As a life-long learner, I am always trying to learn new things, from music-making to culinary skills, and many things in between.
                In my spare time, I am an avid poetry connoisseur, which led me to create, host, and produce the Preaching Poetry Podcast.
                One of my favorite poems is"The Builders" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. 
                His immortal words definitely speak to me as a web developer: 
                <br>
                <br>
                "Nothing useless is, or low;
                Each thing in its place is best;
                And what seems but idle show
                Strengthens and supports the rest.
                For the structure that we raise,
                Time is with materials filled;
                Our to-days and yesterdays
                Are the blocks with which we build."
            </p>

            </a>
            <p>The Horiseon Website has been refactored to match semantic language. I replaced the "divs" with more specific langauge. I also added alternative text to go along with the images to meet accesibility requirements. The CSS has been adjusted to match the new semantic language changes.
